# gorman-tdd

Implementations of the exercises from Jason Gorman's TDD book
available, for free, from his [Codemanship site](http://codemanship.co.uk)
as a [downloadable PDF](http://www.codemanship.co.uk/tdd_jasongorman_codemanship.pdf).

While you might (but probably don't really) want see my solutions
to the exercises, you'll get the real value from reading the book
and trying them yourself, in your favourite (or other!) language.
